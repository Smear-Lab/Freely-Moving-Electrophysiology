Probe mounting materials 

•	Diagnostic biochips probe with attached amplifier chip

•	Microdrive 

•	Flathead screw driver (small enough for Microdrive screw)

•	Viscous gel glue

•	2 pairs of sharp forceps

•	Microscope

•	I like to have a straight needle of some sort 

•	Lab tape

•	Manipulator arm & carrying case

•	Clamp

Prep Microdrive

1.	Sterilize all materials using 3% hydrogen peroxide (except DBC probe). 
2.	Make sure Microdrive and arm are clean. Pin Microdrive in place on the arm using the small screws on the side. Make sure Microdrive is COMPLETELY parallel to the arm before fixing in place. 
3.	Place arm with Microdrive in it securely in a clamp with the Microdrive plate facing upward. Adjust so you can see the Microdrive plate under the microscope. 
4.	Using the screwdriver, adjust the location of the plate so that the ends of the probe will just extend about 1mm over the end of the drive when mounted. Do this before touching probe – you do not want to have to move the plate during surgery or while a probe is mounted. 

Mounting probe

1.	Open probe box and very gently remove tape holding probe and chip in place. 
2.	Fold a piece of lab tape backwards into a tube and put it somewhere on the Microdrive arm (this will hold the amplifier chip in place once the probe is mounted). 
3.	Put a small drop of viscous glue onto the Microdrive plate where you will mount the probe. 
4.	Using two forceps, gently pick up the probe from the amplifier chip, supporting the probe from underneath on the ribbon cable and very gently place probe base onto Microdrive plate and amplifier chip onto rolled piece of lab tape. DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING TO THE ELECTRODE SHANKS. They must remain completely untouched throughout the procedure. 
5.	Press amplifier chip in place. Using straight needle tool, gently press electrode base into glue on Microdrive plate. Then, use straight tool to gently touch probe back and forth until it is COMPLETELY parallel to the Microdrive and manipulator arm. It must be perfectly on axis with the Microdrive for a successful implantation so take your time doing this and examine from all angles. 
6.	Wait for glue to dry completely. Then use viscous glue to build a bridge over the electrode base and further secure it to the drive. Do not get glue on the electrode shanks or anywhere on the drive besides the moveable plate. 
7.	Allow to dry completely before removing manipulator arm from the clamp and carefully placing it in it’s storage box. Make sure this is stored somewhere it will not get bumped/touched/perturbed until your surgery. 
  
Thermistor materials  

•	Thermistor
•	Male side of thermistor pins 
•	Sharp forceps 
•	Soldering iron & supplies
•	Viscous super glue 
•	Alligator clamps 
•	Flat razor 
•	Multimeter

Prep making thermistor

1.	Take thermistor out of bag and cut wire a little over an inch from the bead. More is better than less so it can be reused. 
2.	Hold end of thermistor wire flat against table with nail so you can see the two wires fixed together. Use flat razor to separate these two wires up to a few mm. 
3.	Scrape both sides of wire so copper covering is removed and silver wires are exposed (only on the ends that are separated). 
4.	Set thermistor aside (best to put it in an epindorph tube so you don’t lose it!). 
5.	Take thermistor pins and, if still attached to wire, use forceps or plyers to remove wire from casing as completely as possible. Use male side for thermistors. 
6.	Put pins in a soldering alligator clamp so that the soldering connections are facing upward. 

Building thermistor

1.	Get thermistor and tease separated wires at the end apart until they are the same distance apart as the soldering connections on your pins.  
2.	Using forceps, gently place thermistor onto pins with scraped wire leads sitting inside the soldering connection for pins. 
3.	Melt solder onto soldering connection, embedding thermistor wire inside resin. Do this for both sides. 
4.	Once soldered, test thermistor by setting multimeter to 60kOhm range and touching multimeter leads to each thermistor pins. Passive reading should be around 21kOhm. When you breathe on the thermistor, it should drop to about 14KOhm. 
5.	Once you have a working thermistor, use some glue to strengthen the connection where the wire meets the pins and to protect your soldering site.
