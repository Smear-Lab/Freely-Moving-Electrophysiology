Surgery Prep

For this surgery, you will be squeezing a lot of equipment into a small place. I recommend having all of your drugs/tools/back ups laid out and available to you before surgery. Further, I would recommend shifting the microscope lens upward so the lens is facing further away from you/more towards the wall…it is an uncomfortable way to sit, but allows the manipulator to fit during surgery. It will be tight, but take your time and get the microscope at an angle so that it will NOT bump your manipulator at any point during the procedure.

Sterilize materials that cannot go in the autoclave (any plastic, thermistors, etc.) in 3% hydrogen peroxide for at least 15 minutes before use. 

Anesthesia

1.	Anesthetize by isoflurane (1-3%), delivered by nosecone. 
2.	Position mouse on stereotax with feedback-regulated heating pad at 37° C. 
3.	Cover eyes with ophthalmic sterile ointment to prevent drying. 
4.	Use paw or tail pinch periodically to maintain deep level of anesthesia. 
5.	Administer 0.03mg/kg of buprenorphine IP and 4mg/kg of meloxicam SQ.

Standard incision 

1.	Following deep anesthesia, shave the surgical area (extending from above the nasal bones to the bone overlying the cerebellum) and gently scrub with hibiclens and betadine soap using a sterile cotton-tipped applicator. 
2.	Prior to incision, inject lidocaine (30 uL 10% solution) beneath the scalp at the incision site (I like to do 3 small injections at tip of nose, between eyes, and top of head). 
3.	Make an incision along the midline using a sterile scalpel blade or scissors.
4.	Remove the skin overlying the nose and the dorsomedial skull. Exposed site should extend from nasal bone to bone overlying the cerebellum and reach from eye to eye. 
5.	Carefully and diligently remove the connective tissue and periosteum on the skull using suction/scalpel/forceps/your tool of choice. This site should be completely clean and dry before proceeding. 

Thermistor implantation 

During this part of the procedure, it is essential to keep the olfactory bulb and area directly posterior completely clear in preparation for the electrode implantation. The following procedure is adopted from McAfee et al. 2016. 

1.	Using a dental drill with a sterile FG ¼ drill bit, begin to drill a small hole in the anterior portion of the nasal bone, centered ~0.5mm lateral from the midline suture (see lab Dropbox for photos). 
2.	Move slowly through the layers of bone with the drill. With care, you should be able to drill a hole in the bone without damage to the underlying epithelium. In the best cases, you can see the underlying epithelium pulse with breath. 
3.	The edges of this hole can be lightly cauterized if desired (less than ½ second) to reduce future swelling using a standard surgical cauterizer (I don’t always do this). 
4.	Insert glass bead of thermistor carefully into cavity; partial insertion just under the nasal bone without overtly distending the epithelium. Be careful not to damage the epithelium, but if the nasal epithelium breaks, you can still implant and get a signal. 
5.	You can melt sterile bone wax into the cavity to protect the temperature sensitive element of the thermistor. I have not done this in a while though.
6.	Seal the hole and bead in place with a drop of viscous super glue (viscous so that it does not seep onto the epithelium). I use zip kicker to fix this in place quickly. 
7.	Build up a little glue for stability and set excess wire and connector bent to the side. Preferably, bend it away from your surgical site so it is out of the way. 

Chronic Recordings: craniotomy 

1.	See surgical prep protocol for how to mount probes to microdrive and manipulator arm. 
2.	Center the electrical manipulator over your region of interest (olfactory bulb) by loosening the screw that fixes it to the stereotax and sliding it to the right location, then tightening the screw. I like to put a straight object like a pencil in the manipulator to help me align it. 
3.	Power on the manipulator before continuing surgery…it resets to a home position when powered on and may move out of place from where you would like it. 

Do not put the arm with the electrodes on it in the manipulator yet! Remember for your craniotomy that the bone over the olfactory bulb is very thin and you don’t have to go very far to access the brain. 

4.	Drill a small shallow hole (0.2-0.3mm) in the skull above your region of interest. For 64-128 channel olfactory bulb recordings, I drill a series of small holes from the medial anterior to lateral posterior olfactory bulb (creating a trench). This best avoids the sinus of doom and accesses a large portion of the olfactory bulb for recording. 
5.	Once your craniotomy is complete, remove the dura with a sterile needle (gauge 32) and hydrate the exposed brain with sterile LRS throughout until craniotomy is sealed. 
6.	If any part of this procedure bleeds, patiently wait until the bleeding has stopped. You can alternatively clear blood with gel foam or cold LRS, but patience tends to be your friend here. Best if it doesn’t bleed though. 
7.	Build up a thin wall of gel glue on the bone around the craniotomy. This will protect your tissue from any glue seeping and will allow you to thoroughly irrigate the site throughout your surgery. 

Chronic Recordings: Microdrive-mounted electrode implantation

8.	After the craniotomy is completed and irrigated, place the manipulator arm with the electrodes into the manipulator and orient electrodes at the angle that will fit the entire probe into the trench you have made. 
9.	Gently lower the probe towards the brain region of interest, adjusting position as needed. Once the electrodes are at the surface of the brain, lower about 50-100 microns further so electrodes are inside neural tissue. 
10.	If the shanks bend at all here, it means you have not fully remove the dura and need to raise the probe and continue clearing the dura. It is also possible you are hitting a thin remnant of bone, but you should be able to see this clearly under the microscope. 
11.	Continue irrigating exposed brain with sterile LRS throughout the procedure. 
12.	Once in place, fix electrode Microdrive to skull using your chosen adhesive. Do not get glue near the craniotomy or anywhere on the moveable plate on the front of the drive. I like to use gel super glue with zip kicker to prevent seepage and get things fixed in place quickly. 
13.	Cover the exposed brain with a drop of Kwikcast. 
14.	Build up glue around base of Microdrive to ensure it is solidly fixed in place. 
15.	Once the drive is solidly fixed in place, carefully unscrew the small screw holding the Microdrive to the manipulator arm. 
16.	BEFORE REMOVING THE ARM: ensure the amplifier chip is removed from the arm and taped gently to stereotax out of the way. Also ensure Microdrive is fully free and will not be pulled on if you raise the arm. 
17.	Raise arm using manipulator and then fully remove to give yourself more space to work. 

Chronic Recordings: building the headstage

18.	Adhere a metal headbar between the ears and adhere the amplifier chip against the headbar, leaning backwards towards the body to reduce weight on the anterior part of the skull. Take care during this step to not damage the very delicate ribbon cable in any way including pulling on it. Additionally, be very careful to avoid bumping your electrode/Microdrive set up during this step. 
19.	Create a fence around the electrode site and Microdrive. This can be built using copper mesh and dental cement. I generally use a piece of lab tape (sterilized in hydrogen peroxide) rolled backwards on itself into a tube. I use sterile scissors to shape the bottom of the tube to the mouse’s head to best protect and seal in both the electrodes and Microdrive. Glue the base of the tube to skull while it is around the drive, sealing in the electrodes and Microdrive. 
20.	Fill the fence to the surface wit a mixture of sterile bone wax and mineral oil melted using a cauterizer. I use a cotton swab stick to hold pieces of wax over the tube and melt it in. 
21.	Drill a craniotomy behind the headbar above cerebellum and fix the ground and reference wires that extend out of the amplifier chip solidly into cerebellum using your choice of adhesive. 
22.	Adhere thermistor pins and wire to a convenient part of the implant where they are out of the way, but you will not press on a delicate part of the implant, like the fence, when you plug them in. Embed the thermistor wire in adhesive. 
23.	As a final step, apply dental cement or cyanoacrylate to all exposed skull surface, skin margins, and then around the implant for increased strength and durability. Take your time doing this step! Use thin layers and leave plenty of drying time to optimize the strength of the implant. 

Post-operative care

1.	Allow mice to recover in the surgical suite or a heated recovery unit until the animal is fully awake and moving normally. 
2.	For three days, scrutinize your animal for any signs of pain, such as reluctance to move about, decreased appetite and/or water consumption, weight loss, hunched posture, increased respiration, self-mutilation, or irritation around the surgical site. 
3.	When in doubt, consult with on-call veterinarian.
